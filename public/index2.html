The User&apos;s data collected by the Owner for such purposes include: teh Username, the name of User, the e-mail address and any personal information of the User that may be voluntarily published. Unless the User gives the Data Controller a specific and optional consent to the processing of their data for the further purposes set out in the following paragraphs, the User&apos;s personal data will be used by the Data Controller for the sole purpose of ascertaining the identity of the User (also by validating the e-mail address) thus avoiding possible scams or abuses, and contacting the User only for reasons of service - for example, to send notifications regarding the services offered on the Site relating to the products of the Controller.

<p>
    c) Legal obligations, or to fulfil obligations according to law, to an authority, to a regulation or to European legislation.
</p>
<p>
    The provision of personal data for the processing purposes indicated above is optional but necessary, as failure to provide them will make it impossible for the User to browse the site, register with the Site and take advantage of the services offered by the Controller through the Site.
</p>
<p>
    The personal data necessary to fulfil the purposes of the processing operations described in this paragraph 1 are indicated with an asterisk in the App registration form.

</ol>
<p>
    With the free and optional consent of the User, some personal data of the User - that is the username, the name, the e-mail address -, may also be processed by the Controller for marketing purposes (such as sending advertising material, direct sales, commercial communication, sending newsletters containing information in relation to news relevant to the sector relating to the activities of the Controller), or in order for the Controller to contact you via e-mail, to propose the purchase of products offered by the Controller and/or by third parties, to present offers, promotions and business opportunities of the Controller and/or of third-party companies.
</p>
<p>
    In case of lack of consent, the possibility to pursue the purposes referred to in paragraph 1 will not be affected in any way.
</p>
<p>
    In case of consent, this may be revoked at any time, making a request to the Controller in the manner indicated in the following paragraph 6.
</p>
<p>

If you intend to revoke consent to sending promotional communications via telephone, but still receive promotional communications via email, or vice versa, please send a request to the Controller in the manner indicated in the following paragraph 6.
</p>
<p>
    The Data Controller declares that following exercise of the right to object to receipt of promotional material by email, it is possible that, for technical and operational reasons (e.g. formation of contact lists already completed shortly before the Data Controller&apos;s receipt of the objection) the User continues to receive some additional promotional messages. Should the User continue to receive promotional messages 24 hours after exercising the right to object, please report the problem to the Data Controller, using the contact details indicated in paragraph 6 below.
