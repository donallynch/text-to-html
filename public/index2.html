</p>
<p>
    The provision of personal data for the processing purposes indicated above is optional but necessary, as failure to provide them will make it impossible for the User to browse the site, register with the Site and take advantage of the services offered by the Controller through the Site.
</p>
<p>
    The personal data necessary to fulfil the purposes of the processing operations described in this paragraph 1 are indicated with an asterisk in the App registration form.

</ol>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    In case of lack of consent, the possibility to pursue the purposes referred to in paragraph 1 will not be affected in any way.

</p>
<p>
    The Data Controller declares that following exercise of the right to object to receipt of promotional material by email, it is possible that, for technical and operational reasons (e.g. formation of contact lists already completed shortly before the Data Controller&apos;s receipt of the objection) the User continues to receive some additional promotional messages.
